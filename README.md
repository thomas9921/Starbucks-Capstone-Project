# Udacity Project - Starbucks Capstone Challenge


## Blog
Medium - 

## Installations
This project was written in the Anaconda environment and Python 3.7

## Motivation
I chose this project because of the business application.  I wanted to try to understand the financial benefit or finacial cost of the member program. In order to do that I asked the following questions: 

What amount of revenue is driven through the membership program?
What is the revenue adjusment cost of the program?
How could Starbucks target their members with offers to improve their return on investment?


## Files
This repository contains the following files:

Starbucks_Capston_notebook.ipynb - Code for data clensing, analysis, and machine learning.
visuals.py - Code for visuals - Udacity
portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json - demographic data for each customer
transcript.json -  records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

Summary
Overall about 40% of offers sent out get completed. This varys some between offer types but mostly stays consistant. I believe Starbucks should increase their informational offers sent out since they have the highest completion rate and least cost. I also believe Starbucks should use machine learning to improve their results and increase revenue. 

## Acknowledgements
- the visuals.py code was created by Udacity for the supervised learning project in the Data Science Nano Degree program.
