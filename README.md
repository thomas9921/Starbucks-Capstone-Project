# Udacity Project - Starbucks Capstone Challenge


## Blog
Medium - 

## Installations
This project was written in the Anaconda environment and Python 3.7

## Motivation
I chose this project because of the business application.  I wanted to try to understand the financial benefit or finacial cost of the member program. In order to do that I asked the following questions: 

What amount of revenue is driven through the membership program?
What is the revenue adjusment cost of the program?
How could Starbucks target their members with offers to improve their return on investment?


## Files
This repository contains the following files:

Starbucks_Capston_notebook.ipynb - Code for data clensing, analysis, and machine learning.
visuals.py - Code for visuals - Udacity
portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json - demographic data for each customer
transcript.json -  records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

Summary
There are some interesting findings in this dataset however I believe that more data is needing in order to come to any conclusions. We found that African Americans are over represented in the fatal shootings of police offices, however they are also over represented in total arrests. More data and analysis needs to be done on arrest information. We also found that African Americans are on average shot at a younger age then other races, and the data would suggest more likely to flee the scene. However, they are also less likely to have a weapon or attack.

## Acknowledgements
- the visuals.py code was created by Udacity for the supervised learning project in the Data Science Nano Degree program.
